# ltl_automaton_planner

## Overview
An LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) planner implementation based on LTL2BA and LTL automaton. Takes as input a set of transitions system to build an action model, and a LTL formula (with hard and soft components).

A non-deterministic state graph, called product graph, is generated from the product of the Buchi automaton and the action model. This product graph is used to track possible agent state and generate a plan and action sequence for the agent.
